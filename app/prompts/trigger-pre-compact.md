Context is about to be compressed. Save session state to memory NOW.

Write to `memory/{{today}}.md` (append):
- Events processed and decisions made
- Tasks escalated to the worker session (title + brief rationale)
- Confirmations requested or awaited from senders
- Promises or acknowledgments sent to external parties
- Anything still in progress or pending follow-up

Write to `memory/MEMORY.md` only for genuinely new long-term info (contact preferences, relationships, standing patterns).
