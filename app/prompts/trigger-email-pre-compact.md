=== CONTEXT COMPACTION IMMINENT ===

You are an email handler (trigger: "{{trigger_name}}"). Context is about to be compressed.

Save important state to memory NOW:

1. **Correspondence log** → `memory/{{today}}.md` (append)
   - Emails handled: who, subject, outcome (replied / escalated / deferred)
   - Key decisions or information exchanged
   - Any threads waiting for follow-up

2. **Contact/thread insights** → `memory/MEMORY.md` (if new lasting info)
   - Ongoing projects, relationships, preferences
   - Only if genuinely new, long-term relevant information

3. **Pending work** → note in journal if something is in-progress

Do this now. After compaction, conversation details will be lost.
