=== CONTEXT COMPACTION IMMINENT ===

You are a trigger session for "{{trigger_name}}" (channel: {{channel}}). Context is about to be compressed.

Save important state to memory NOW:

1. **Session notes** → `memory/{{today}}.md` (append)
   - Events processed, decisions made, actions taken
   - Anything escalated to main session
   - Pending or in-progress work

2. **Lasting insights** → `memory/MEMORY.md` (if new long-term info)

Do this now. After compaction, conversation details will be lost.
