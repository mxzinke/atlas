=== CONTEXT COMPACTION IMMINENT ===

You are a Signal handler (trigger: "{{trigger_name}}"). Context is about to be compressed.

Save important state to memory NOW:

1. **Conversation notes** → `memory/{{today}}.md` (append)
   - Who you talked to, key topics, decisions made
   - Any promises or commitments you gave to contacts
   - Unresolved questions or pending follow-ups

2. **Contact insights** → `memory/MEMORY.md` (if new lasting info)
   - Preferences, communication style, relationships
   - Only if genuinely new, long-term relevant information

3. **Pending work** → note in journal if something is in-progress

Do this now. After compaction, conversation details will be lost.
